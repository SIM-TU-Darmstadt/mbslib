done - add proper base for all stuff that needs integration, three methods: 
  -- integrate
  -- store
  -- restore

done - add proper base for force generators with a control-value and handle this properly, especially when deriving sensitivity matrices

- think about a validity flag for the equilibrum-condition of compounds

done think about a way to handle derived classes inheriting parameters (currently only the parameters of the child class are exposed through the parameter interface)

- todo: in MuscleModel: enforce derivatives by introducing two separate methods for force dforce/du and checking for the derivemode in Musclemodel itself

- todo: get rid of drives in MbsCompound. think about a good way to achieve this goal.

done expand IControllable to accept more than one control value. This also requires changes to the way control-values are accessed through MbsCompound! 

done expand IControllable to be more talkative about the control-value.

- todo: check if Sensitivity-Calculation is compatible with gravity

- todo: add a derive-mode for spring-models by l and dl

- todo: fix isnan-issue in types.h so that it works on all platforms

done - make a master CMakeLists.txt in the project's root directory

done - make tutorials build with adolc, should be simple :-) yes, it was ;-)

done - when adding objects with IIntegrate, sort them into joints and non joints, count states and provide methods to access the state-vectors of the mbs

done - add method to ask for IIntegrate to IForceGenerator. This way, a ForceGenerator can be asked whether it is stageful, but needs not be a subclass of IIntegrate
