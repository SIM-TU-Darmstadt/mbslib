- Using gravity or external force/torque will lead to unchecked acceleration propagation in DirKin.
  The reason for this is the testset has to be specified in equilibrium, which is only valid if the
  dynamics have been computed (which DirKin naturally doesn't).
- the tests only check static conditions, no trajectories so far
- setting base acceleration/velocity for a fixed based is forbidden (unspecified behaviour in most
  frameworks)
- when using a free base invDyn not allowed -> hybrid problem
- (possibly/to decide) when using a free base acceleration and angular accerleration will not be set on the base - only checked
